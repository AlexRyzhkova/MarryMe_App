**THIS IS A FINAL PROJECT FOR MY WEB DEVELOPER BOOTCAMP AT [neue fische](https://www.neuefische.de/)**

Marry Me is the app which helps you plan and organize your wedding. With the to-do list, guest list and budget planning you can keep track of all the important things.

## 📲 Design and layout infos

The app is designed and laid out for smartphone screens, so adjust the settings in your view accordingly to IPhone 5 or 6/7/8.

## 🔧 Development

### Requirements

Node.js and npm

### 👨‍💻 Install all dependencies

`npm install`

Since there is a postinstall, the system automatically searches the client folder and installs the required dependencies there, too.

### 💻 Run dev server with:

`npm run dev`
